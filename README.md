## How choosing the right post title can (or can't) help drive engagement

Like it or not, most books are judged by their covers. A catchy title or graphic can be the difference between the NYT bestseller's list and the literary wilderness. In this analysis, I used Natural Language Proccessing (NLP) to examine the impact of a post's title on its resulting 'virality' as measured by the number of comments it elicited.

*(NOTE: 'virality' is in quotes above because I defined it loosely to be the difference between a post being below the 24th percentile (< 3 comments) and above the 75th percentile (> 14 comments))*
