# Examining the virality of Reddit posts
## How choosing the right post title can (or can't) help drive engagement

Like it or not, most books are judged by their covers. A catchy title or graphic can be the difference between the bestseller's list and the literary wilderness. In this analysis, I looked at two Reddit subreddits (stock and ["Funny"](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/) to see if their were patterns in popular posts' titles and, if so, what they were. To this end, I applied various natural language proccessing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to identify the drivers of 'virality'- as measured by the number of comments it elicited.

*(NOTE: 'virality' is in quotes above because I defined it loosely to be the difference between a post being below the 24th percentile (< 3 comments) and above the 75th percentile (> 14 comments))*
